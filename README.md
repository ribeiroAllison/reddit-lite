## What is it?

It is a web app that lets you `browse through reddit` and a few selected subreddits.

## Why it is?

This was an exercise suggested by Codecademy's `Front End Engineer` course.

## Project Goal

Solidify knowledge in Redux toolkit, I also backed myself into some corners so I could `find new solutions` to old problems.

> **The self-imposed restrictions to the project were:**

- No `data transformations` from API should be done by a component.
- `No CSS`, just use bootstrap (OK, I cheated on this one a little bit).
- Only `one route` allowed.
- No `any` type inside the application (type any for objects from API are OK).

## Main technologies used:

#### • React.js

#### • Next.js

#### • Typescript

#### • Redux Toolkit

## Here is the deployed finished program, hope you like it!: [Redux Lite](https://reddit-lite-two.vercel.app//)
